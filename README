I base on wbg express-base-controller to build a controller more useful and more powerful, it provides several functionnality like :

* Calling action
* Forward action
* Auto render
* DashToCamel writing
* Boostrap
* Custom route
* etc..

It take some inspiration from Zend Framework Controller that is so good.

You can add method to bootstrap.js to let clean the app.js file.

You can add custom route easyly, there is an example in the boostrap.

To write new controllers, just add them in the controllers folder.

To run the demo you can simply clone the project and launch :

node app.js

You can test at the url : http://localhost:8080/
